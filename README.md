# Cross-Platform Mobile ZKPs

Flutter is a popular cross-platform mobile app development framework. Mopro Flutter shows an example of integrating ZK-proving into a Flutter app, allowing for streamlined creation of ZK-enabled mobile apps.

## Running The Example App

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Flutter**

   If Flutter is not already installed, you can follow the [official Flutter installation guide](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install) for your operating system.

2. **Check Flutter Environment**

   After installing Flutter, verify that your development environment is properly set up by running the following command in your terminal:

   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

   This command will identify any missing dependencies or required configurations.

3. **Install Flutter Dependencies**

   Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   flutter pub get
   ```

   This will install the necessary dependencies for the project.

### Running the App via VS Code

1. Open the project in VS Code.
2. Open the "Run and Debug" panel.
3. Start an emulator (iOS/Android) or connect your physical device.
4. Select "example" in the run menu and press "Run".

### Running the App via Console

If you prefer using the terminal to run the app, use the following steps:

1. Navigate to the `example` directory of the project:

   ```bash
   cd example
   ```

2. For Android:

   Ensure you have an Android emulator running or a device connected. Then run:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

3. For iOS:

   Make sure you have an iOS simulator running or a device connected. Then run:

   ```bash
   flutter run
   ```

## Integrating Your ZKP

The example app comes with a simple prover generated from a Circom circuit. To integrate your own prover, follow the steps below.

### Setup

Follow the [Rust Setup steps from the MoPro official docs](https://zkmopro.org/docs/getting-started/rust-setup) to generate the platform-specific libraries.

### Copying The Generated Libraries

#### iOS

1. Replace `mopro.swift` at [`ios/Classes/mopro.swift`](ios/Classes/mopro.swift) with the file generated during the [Setup](#setup).
2. Replace the directory [`ios/MoproBindings.xcframework`](ios/MoproBindings.xcframework) with the one generated during the [Setup](#setup).

#### Android

1. Replace the directory [`android/src/main/jniLibs`](android/src/main/jniLibs) with the one generated during the [Setup](#setup).
2. Replace `mopro.kt` at [`android/src/main/kotlin/uniffi/mopro/mopro.kt`](android/src/main/kotlin/uniffi/mopro/mopro.kt) with the file generated during the [Setup](#setup).

### zKey

1. Place your `.zkey` file in your app's assets folder. For example, to run the included example app, you need to replace the `.zkey` at [`example/assets/multiplier2_final.zkey`](example/assets/multiplier2_final.zkey) with your file. If you change the `.zkey` file name, don't forget to update the asset definition in your app's [`pubspec.yaml`](example/pubspec.yaml):

   ```yaml
   assets:
     - assets/your_new_zkey_file.zkey
   ```

2. Load the new `.zkey` file properly in your Dart code. For example, update the file path in [`example/lib/main.dart`](example/lib/main.dart):

   ```dart
   var inputs = <String, List<String>>{};
   inputs["a"] = ["3"];
   inputs["b"] = ["5"];
   proofResult = await _moproFlutterPlugin.generateProof("assets/multiplier2_final.zkey", inputs);
   ```

Don't forget to modify the input values for your specific case!
